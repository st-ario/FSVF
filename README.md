# FSVF (Fast Small Vectors of Floats)

! This library is still only a draft !

A SIMD library for single-precision 3D and 4D linear algebra heavily optimized for desktop x86_64
architectures.

## Goals

FSVF uses SIMD instructions to greatly increase the performance of common 3D and 4D operations used
in graphical applications and games. The algorithms used are tailor-made to maximise performance
across all modern desktop and high-end laptop user CPUs.
